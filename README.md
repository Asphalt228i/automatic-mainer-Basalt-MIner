a script that will mine blocks for you


to get started with the script, download python and download the latest version of my script

open Basalt Miner like this

![1](https://github.com/Asphalt228i/automatic-mainer-Basalt-MIner/assets/98819672/011cb349-e962-4385-979e-56ead0069964)


then we take a screenshot and use any graphic editor I personally use GIMP (I will show using GIMP as an example) go into the program and import our skinshot


![3](https://github.com/Asphalt228i/automatic-mainer-Basalt-MIner/assets/98819672/7471114b-3354-438b-8979-3a9a0a8558c2)

then select our block with the "framing" tool and look at the value underlined in the screenshot

![2](https://github.com/Asphalt228i/automatic-mainer-Basalt-MIner/assets/98819672/1ab7d6a2-a830-4667-a371-0bd53ac3a08b)


then we write the data to the opened console, the first value is on the left, the second on top

after that, the script will work itself, to turn off the script, press the ctrl + shift + Esc combination and find the miner.exe file and stop it

if you want to help me add more mine, just take screenshots of each high level mine block and send it to me on discord widra_sire#3219
